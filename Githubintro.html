<h1> Github and its essentials </h1>
<body> Github is a code hosting platform which allows versioning and collaboration. It provides a web based graphical interface.
       Its essentials are as follows:
       <UL>
        1. Repository: It contains files, media and data sheets. It helps organise a single project with several files.<br>
        2. Branches: It helps us work on different versions of a repository at the same time.It is used for correction of syntax and then merging when the change is done.
                     A default branch called master is created. Github allows any changes in the master to be pulled into the new branch created (other than master)
                     Before merging the newly created branch into the master branch the changes have to be commited and then requests are to be pulled in, discussed and then merged.<br>
        3. Commits: These are saved changes each of which are are associated with a commit message which tells you why the change has been done.<br> 
        4. Pull requests: These are requests sent to other users requesting them to pull in your requests and merge them into their branch. a pull request can be opened even before the coding is done.<br> 
                          Pull requests can be merged.<br>
        </UL>
