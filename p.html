                        A savings account is an interest-bearing deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution that provides a modest 
                        interest rate. Financial institutions that offer savings accounts may limit the number of withdrawals from an account each month.
                        A savings account is a deposit account held at a retail bank that pays interest but cannot be used directly as money in the narrow 
                        sense of a medium of exchange (for example, by writing a cheque). These accounts let customers set aside a portion of their liquid 
                        assets while earning a monetary return.The other major types of deposit accounts are the transactional account, money market account 
                        and time deposit. In the US, the term "savings deposit" includes a deposit or an account that meets the requirements of Sec. 204 of 
                        Regulation D. The depositor is permitted to make up to 6 pre-authorized transfers or withdrawals (excluding withdrawals via an automated 
                        teller machine) per month or a statement cycle of at least four weeks. There is no regulation limiting number of deposits into the account. 
                        Violations of Regulation D often involve a service charge, usually $10 per transaction, or even a downgrade of the account to a checking account.
                        A savings account linked to a checking account at the same financial institution can help prevent fees due to overdrafts and reduce banking costs.

                        A fixed deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided by banks or NBFCs which provides investors a higher rate of 
                        interest than a irregular savings account, until the given maturity date. It may or may not require the creation of a 
                        separate account. A fixed deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided by banks or NBFCs which provides investors a higher rate of

                        It is known as a term deposit or time deposit in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the US, and as a bond in the United Kingdom and India. 
                        For a fixed deposit is that the money cannot be withdrawn from the FD as compared to a recurring deposit or a demand deposit before maturity. 
                        Some banks may offer additional services to FD holders such as loans against FD certificates at competitive interest rates. It's important to 
                        note that banks may offer lesser interest rates under uncertain economic conditions. The interest rate varies between 4 and 7.50 percent. 
                        The tenure of an FD can vary from 7, 15 or 45 days to 1.5 years and can be as high as 10 years. These investments are safer than Post Office Schemes

                        Recurring Deposit is a special kind of Term Deposit offered by banks in India which help people with regular incomes to deposit a fixed amount 
                        every month into their Recurring Deposit account and earn interest at the rate applicable to Fixed Deposits. Recurring Deposit is a special kind of 
                        Term Deposit offered by banks in India which help people with regular incomes to deposit a fixed amount every month into their Recurring Deposit account 
                        and earn interest at the rate applicable to Fixed Deposits. It is similar to making FDs of a certain amount in monthly installments, for example ₹ 1000 every month. 
                        This deposit matures on a specific date in the future along with all the deposits made every month. Thus, Recurring Deposit schemes allow customers with an 
                        opportunity to build up their savings through regular monthly deposits of fixed sum over a fixed period of time. Minimum Period of RD is 6 months and 
                        maximum is 10 years.The Recurring Deposit can be funded by Standing instructions which are the instructions by the customer to the bank to withdraw a certain 
                        sum of money from his Savings/ Current account and debit to the Recurring Deposit account.
                        When the RD account is opened, the maturity value is indicated to the customer assuming that the monthly installments will be paid regularly on due dates. 
                        If any installment is delayed, the interest payable in the account will be reduced and will not be sufficient to reach the maturity value. Therefore, 
                        the difference in interest will be deducted from the maturity value as a penalty. The rate of penalty will be fixed upfront. Interest is compounded on 
                        quarterly basis in recurring deposits. One can avail loans against the collateral of Recurring deposit up to 80 to 90% of the deposit value.
                        Rate of Interest offered is similar to that of Fixed Deposits. Earlier it seemed to be one of the best method to save the amount yield after years of deposit.

                            In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations etc. 
                            The recipient (i.e. the borrower) incurs a debt, and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid, and also to repay the principal 
                            amount borrowed. The document evidencing the debt, e.g. a promissory note, will normally specify, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, 
                            the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between 
                            the lender and the borrower. The interest provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan. In a legal loan, each of these obligations and 
                            restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. Although this article focuses 
                            on monetary loans, in practice any material object might be lent. Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions such 
                            as banks and credit card companies. For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding. There are 5 types of loans:<br>
                            <ul>
                                1. SECURED: A secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or house) as collateral. A mortgage loan is a very common type 
                                            of loan, used by many individuals to purchase residential property. The lender, usually a financial institution, is given security (a lien on 
                                            the title to the property) until the mortgage is paid off in full. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the bank would have the legal right to 
                                            repossess the house and sell it, to recover sums owing to it.<br>
                                2. UNSECURED: Unsecured loans are monetary loans that are not secured against the borrower's assets. These may be available from financial institutions 
                                              under many different guises or marketing packages. Interest rates on unsecured loans are nearly always higher than for secured loans because 
                                              an unsecured lender's options for recourse against the borrower in the event of default are severely limited, subjecting the lender to higher risk 
                                              compared to that encountered for a secured loan. An unsecured lender must sue the borrower, obtain a money judgment for breach of contract, and then 
                                              pursue execution of the judgment against the borrower's unencumbered assets (that is, the ones not already pledged to secured lenders).<br> 
                                3. DEMAND: Demand loans are short-term loans that typically do not have fixed dates for repayment. Instead, demand loans carry a floating interest rate which 
                                           varies according to the prime lending rate or other defined contract terms. Demand loans can be "called" for repayment by the lending institution at any time. 
                                           Demand loans may be unsecured or secured.<br>
                                4. SUBSIDIZED: A subsidized loan is a loan on which the interest is reduced by an explicit or hidden subsidy. In the context of college loans in the United States, 
                                               it refers to a loan on which no interest is accrued while a student remains enrolled in education.<br>        
                                5. CONCESSIONAL: A concessional loan, sometimes called a "soft loan", is granted on terms substantially more generous than market loans either through below-market 
                                                 interest rates, by grace periods or a combination of both. Such loans may be made by foreign governments to developing countries or may be 
                                                 offered to employees of lending institutions as an employee benefit.<br>
