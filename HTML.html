<h1>INTRO TO HTML</h1>
<body>The Hypertext Markup Language descibes the structure of web pages using markups. HTML is not case sensitive.
    Its elements are represented by tags. Tags are enclosed in angular brackets. Browsers do not display these tags instead use them to convey messages. There are many such tags:
    <ul>1. The img tag is use to display images.
        2. The title tag is used to give tab titles.
        3. The head tag is used to give information of the location, title and subject.
        4. The tags h1 to h6 are used to write heading of different fonts starting from the highest one where h1 defines the most important heading and h6 the least one.
        5. The p tag is used to define a new paragraph.
        6. The body tag defines the main page content.
        7. The br or the break tag is an empty element with no closing tag. It defines a line break. 
    </ul>
    Every tag has a start tag and an end tag where the end tag is given by a forward slash preceeding the name of the tag again enclosed by angular brackets.
    The code enclosed in the body tag is the content which is to be displayed on the main screen. A tag defined by an exclamatory mark and DOCTYPE is used for the document declaration which is not case sensitive and represents type of document.
    HTML can be written on notepad if on windows or on Text Edit on mac.
